<dd><p class="first">Collin found Django in November 2006. He was in awe of the admin and ORM

like redirecting after a successful POST request. Why had he never learned
this before? No one knows to this day.</p>
<p>He enjoys helping people on the <a class="reference internal" href="mailing-lists.html#django-users-mailing-list"><em>django-users</em></a> mailing list and making
Django simple and easy for newcomers.</p>

his hand at improving the ORM support for analytics. His contributions
focus on giving more power to users of the ORM.</p>
